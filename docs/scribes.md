# WG meeting scribes

Scribing in WG calls happens as per the list below: We always pick the first person from *"Next up"*, with the next person(s) being the alternate(s). After scribing, the person moves to the end of *"Already scribed"* (folks with a number after them have scribed more than once already). Some folks are exempt (you can present your case to the chairs; [ESL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_second_or_foreign_language) is a potential reason), and some we have never seen in meetings (but would welcome as participants and/or as scribes!).
